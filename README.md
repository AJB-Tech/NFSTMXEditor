# Need for Speed TMX Editor
A tool which allows for editing (but not creation) of TMX audio container files, used in some EA Black Box Need for Speed games.

# Usage
Back up files before use!

Open a TMX file from the file picker. In the Edit tab you can select any of the GIN/SNR files within the TMX container and replace them with another existing one. As the TMX header is relatively unknown, the TMX file you choose to edit will likely have a large impact on the resultant sound. Due to the (current) lack of understanding it is heavily recommended to experiment with different TMX files and see how they sound in-game.
